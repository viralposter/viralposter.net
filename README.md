## Welcome to Viralposter.net
I'm experimenting with jsDelivr, Google, Cloudflare to put 99% website files over CDN (content delivery network).
Only the HTML, PHP is loader from my hosting provider Css, JS, Images is loaded in the CDN.

According to the speed test performed, I notice that my site loads much faster when I put all the files in jsDelivr.
