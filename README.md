## Welcome to Viralposter.net
I'm experimenting with jsDelivr, Google, Cloudflare, Github to put 99% website files over CDN (content delivery network).
Only the HTML, PHP is loader from my hosting provider Css, JS, Images is loaded in the CDN.

According to the speed test performed, I notice that my site loads much faster in the whole world when I put all the files in jsDelivr, Github.
